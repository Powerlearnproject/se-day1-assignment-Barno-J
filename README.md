Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the systematic development, testing, deployment and maintenance of high quality software products using engineering principles, methods and tools. 
It is important in the tech industry as it creates software systems and applications to meet user needs in various aspects including healthcare. These software solutions are reliable, scalable, efficient, innovative and secure.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s. The need for structured approaches to development became apparent as software systems became larger and more complex.
The development of structured programming in 1970s. This emphasized a clearer and more understandable code.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. The focus shifted to delivering small, functional pieces of software frequently, allowing teams to adapt quickly to user feedback and changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Gathering user needs and system requirements.
Design- Creating the framework including a detailed design of the software architecture and use interface.
Implementation- write code.
Testing- Ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- Release the software to user or customer.
Maintenance- Provide support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies involves a sequential approach with distinct phases and testing done at the end of the development process whereas agile methodologies involve iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and continuous responding to change.
Waterfall is well suited for large projects with well defined characteristics that are unlikely to change such as updating a software while agile is well suited for projects with evolving requirements such as tech startups.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Sofware Developer- Writing code and implementing software solutions, collaborating with other team members to ensure best practices while at it and reporting to the project manager about his progress.
Quality Assurance Engineer- Creates development standards and tests to ensure quality software, identifies bugs and suggests changes to be made. Develops and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g Visual Studio. It offers productivity features like autocompletion.
VCS track changes to source code and coordinates work among team members e.g Git. It facilitates collaboration and maintains a safe and recoverable development process.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technological advancements puts pressure on software engineers to stay current.
Changing requirements leading to scope creep and project delays,
Tight deadlines leading to rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical debt from shortcuts and suboptimal solutions leading to increased maintenance cost in the long term.
These challenges can be overcome through agile methodologies, effective communication, regular reassessment of project goals and prioritization of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing individual components, units or modules of software to ensure that each unit performs its intended purpose correctly on its own.
Integration testing- testing the interaction between different components or modules to ensure they work well together and there is smooth data flows.
System testing- testing the whole software system to ensure it meets all the functional and non-functional requirements like performance, usability and security.
Acceptance testing- ensuring that the software has met the user needs and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is when/ the process of guiding AI models through crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses/ solutions.
Prompt engineering improves the interaction between humans and AI by ensuring users get relevant results on the first prompt, and eliminates existing human bias.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Plan an event.
Improved- Plan a four hours team-building event of twenty participants in Olive Gardens, with light resfreshments, starting with two indoor activities and later two outdoor activities, to start at 10 am.
The improved prompt is clear in that it specifies the type of event and the kind of focus. It is specific as it provides details on the event, susch the agenda, location, audience and the duration including what time it should begin. It is also concise as the information is straight forward.
